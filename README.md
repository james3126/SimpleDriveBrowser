# SimpleDriveBrowser
A Simple Drive Browser coded in Python, making use of EasyGUI.

Developed to bypass group policy control over visibility / accessibility of drives.
Python is normally running under the SYSTEM account, giving you the ability to
pass data through python and access what you normally can't.

No real use beyond this, as a simple windows explorer.exe beats this 100x over easily.
